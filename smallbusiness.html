            <h2 class="mb-4">A Tale of Two Approaches to Property Maintenance</h2>
            <p class="lead">Both Victoria and Anna run successful cafés in the city. The year begins, and both are faced with property maintenance challenges—but while their challenges are similar, their approaches couldn't be more different.  

At the start of the year, Victoria chooses to subscribe to BuildaaS, purchasing a 30-hour annual support package. This gives her access to dedicated full-time tradespeople for all her property maintenance needs, with 24/7 support and no premium call-out charges.  

Meanwhile, Anna sticks to the traditional method—relying on her network of friends in the trades and calling in independent contractors as needed. She assumes this will be cheaper and more flexible, and she believes she can coordinate the different tradespeople on her own.  

Let’s follow their stories throughout the year to see how each approach plays out.

                    <p>At the beginning of the year, BuildaaS conducts a comprehensive property assessment at Victoria's café, documenting every detail from plumbing to electrical systems. A customized maintenance calendar is created, ensuring all systems are regularly checked and maintained. With her BuildaaS membership, Victoria gains access to a dedicated team of full-time professionals who are always available whenever she needs them.  </p>

                    <p>In March, Victoria notices a minor plumbing issue—the sink has a slow drain. She logs the issue in the BuildaaS online portal, and within 24 hours, a qualified plumber from the BuildaaS team arrives. The issue is quickly diagnosed and fixed without additional charges. The time spent is logged and deducted from her pre-purchased hours. No surprises.</p>

                    <p>Anna experiences the same plumbing issue in her café. She calls a plumber friend, who says he can come in a few days. After a week of delays, he finally shows up, but the work takes longer than expected, and Anna’s charged for additional materials, plus a premium for the “rush” service.  </p>

                    <p>During a particularly hot summer week, Victoria’s air conditioning system breaks down. She logs the issue in her BuildaaS portal. The 24/7 help desk immediately responds, and a BuildaaS HVAC specialist is dispatched. The technician arrives the same day, repairs the system, and logs the time in the portal—again, with no surprise fees or delays.  </p>

                    <p>Anna faces the same issue in the heat of summer. She calls a local HVAC technician she’s worked with before, but they’re booked out for several days. Desperate, Anna calls another contractor who charges a “premium emergency fee” for same-day service. The repair is rushed and costs Anna more than expected.  </p>

                    <p>Victoria needs an electrical upgrade for a new lighting system. She contacts BuildaaS to handle the task. The technician arrives promptly, is fully equipped, and completes the job efficiently. The work is high-quality, and there’s no disruption to her café’s operations. Everything is logged and documented in her BuildaaS portal, from the materials used to the time spent.  </p>

                    <p>Anna also needs an electrical upgrade and decides to call in two different electricians for the job (one for wiring and another for the light fixture installation). The first electrician is delayed and causes the second one to arrive late. The two tradespeople don’t work in sync, and the job takes much longer than anticipated. To make matters worse, the second electrician has to redo some of the first electrician’s work because the quality is inconsistent.  </p>

                    <p>As the year ends, Victoria reviews her BuildaaS portal. All the work completed throughout the year—whether routine maintenance, emergency repairs, or compliance checks—is neatly documented. She sees that her remaining 5 hours are rolled over into the next year. Her BuildaaS membership was cost-effective, even with unexpected repairs. The ability to roll over hours allows her to maintain a predictable budget for the upcoming year.  </p>

                    <p>At year’s end, Anna scrambles to collect invoices from the various tradespeople she used throughout the year. The records are a mix of receipts, email quotes, and hand-written notes—some of which are incomplete or hard to decipher. She realizes she’s spent more than expected, especially on premium call-out fees, and has no clear record of how much time was spent on each task or who worked on what.  </p>
